Here to change the mode change in mac32.sv module for whichever mode you need.

Also I have created two run files where run.do for Questasim and  run.tcl for Vivado simulation

a) Mode 1: Low Approximation
b) Mode 2: High Approximation
c) Mode 3: Very High Approximation
d) Mode 4: Accurate Mode (Baseline Reference)
